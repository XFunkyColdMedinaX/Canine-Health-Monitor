Description:

In this Biomedical Engineering capstone project, we have designed a health monitoring system integrated into a dog harness. The harness incorporates an Arduino Uno module along with additional peripherals, including an oximeter sensor, a functional ECG sensor, and a wireless transmitter. We have developed functional code using Arduino's C-like language to wirelessly transmit data from the Arduino Uno module.

The transmitted data is received and processed by a laptop equipped with a Python-based monitoring application. This application provides real-time monitoring of the dog's vital statistics, including a heart rate (BPM), ECG chart, oxygen level, and temperature.
